## 📝 Implementation Details

### JWT Claims Used in Policies
```json
{
  "role": "author|reviewer|chair|invitee",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "sub": "google_user_id"
}
```

### Policy Evaluation Flow
1. User makes database query
2. PostgREST extracts JWT claims
3. RLS policies evaluate current_setting('request.jwt.claims')
4. Policies check role and email against claims
5. Rows are automatically filtered
6. Only authorized rows returned

### Type Casting Applied
```sql
-- UUID to text (for comparison with varchar fields)
submissions.submission_id::text = revised_submissions.submission_id

-- Text casting in WHERE clauses
WHERE submissions.submission_id::text = final_camera_ready_submissions.submission_id
```

### Security Tests
- [ ] Cross-role data isolation
- [ ] Anonymous user restrictions
- [ ] JWT claim validation
- [ ] Type casting edge cases

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Query performance with RLS
- [ ] Policy evaluation overhead
- [ ] Large dataset handling
- [ ] Concurrent user scenarios
