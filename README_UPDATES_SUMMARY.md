-- Check authentication
auth.role() = 'authenticated'
```

### 4. **Configuration Section** - RLS Setup
**Before**: Only Cloudinary & Email setup
**After**: Added "Supabase Configuration" subsection with:
- **Enable RLS Policies** (5 steps)
  1. Go to SQL Editor
  2. Copy RLS_MIGRATION.sql
  3. Paste into SQL Editor
  4. Execute (⚠️ with service_role key)
  5. Verify policies created

- **JWT Configuration (Automatic)**
  - Supabase automatic JWT claim handling
  - No additional setup required

- **Verify RLS is Working**
  - Test procedures for each role
  - Expected results

---

### 5. **New Section: Troubleshooting RLS Issues**
**Status**: NEW SECTION (not in original)
**Content Includes**:

#### Problem: "User cannot see their own submissions"
- Check email storage (case-sensitive)
- Verify JWT claims
- Check policy enabled
- Browser DevTools verification

#### Problem: "operator does not exist: uuid = text"
- Type casting solution
- UUID/text comparison fix

#### Problem: "Reviewer cannot see all submissions"
- Verify reviewer role in JWT
- Check policy existence

- Chair role test

#### Problem: "RLS policy not working after deployment"
- Check RLS enabled on tables
- Verify service_role key usage
- Check DROP IF EXISTS patterns
- Run full script

#### Problem: "Anonymous users see no data"
- Expected behavior explanation
- Table access matrix
- Authenticated client usage
