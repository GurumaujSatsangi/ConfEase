<b>An Integrated Toolkit for End-to-End Conference Management</b>
<Br>
The toolkit is built around a role-based access system that caters to the specific needs of each user group, ensuring a seamless and intuitive workflow.
<ul>

  <li><b>Conference Hosting:</b> Conference chairs can initiate and configure new conferences, define submission deadlines, assign reviewers, and oversee the entire operational flow through a dedicated administrative dashboard.
</li>
<li><b>Submission and Collaboration:</b> Primary authors can submit their initial papers through a secure portal. Upon submission, a unique paper code is generated, which can be shared with co-authors to grant them access for collaboration and contribution to the manuscript.
</li>

<li>
<b>Peer Review and Decision:</b> Once submitted, papers are assigned to reviewers for evaluation. Based on the collective feedback and scores from the review process, a decision (e.g., Accepted, Minor/Major Revisions, Rejected) is made. Authors are notified automatically and, if accepted, are prompted to submit the final, camera-ready version of their paper.

</li>

<li>
<b>Scheduling and Presentation:</b> Following the final submission, the system schedules the presentation slots and informs the authors of the confirmed date and time. This information is updated in real-time on the user's personal dashboard.

</li>

<li>
<b>Live Evaluation and Result Generation:</b> During the conference presentation, designated panelists can access a digital evaluation form directly on the platform. They can submit scores and qualitative remarks in real-time. The system then aggregates all review scores and panelist feedback to automatically calculate and generate the final results, ensuring a transparent and efficient evaluation process.      </div>

</li>
</ul>
